## About Me ##

Hello! My name is Daniella (or Dani, for short). I often find it difficult to describe myself since my attention is constantly being captured by new intellectual pursuits or slightly less-intellectual diy projects. Currently, I work at a brewery and am attempting to learn more about beer styles and composition so as to one day brew my own beer. I also consider myself an artist, and am working on commissions (pen is my preferred medium) when I am not working at the brewery or traveling with my partner. 

## Past Coding Experience ## 

My coding experience only dates back to Fall 2021, where I took a class called "Data Science and Human Rights" during my last semester of undergrad. Here, I was able to work with R Studio to manipulate data and conduct research based off my findings. My frustration with my limited coding knowledge led me to attempt to teach myself how to code, starting with Java. Only a month in to my self-education, I applied and was accepted to the Web Design Graduate program here at UF. While working on art commissions, I do my best to educate myself by listening to coding podcasts that fill me in on industry trends. 

## Career Goals ##

1. Get accepted to a job as a Graphic/Web Designer for a brewery.
2. Graduate with my Master's degree in Web Design.
3. Continue to learn coding language, earning certifications. 
4. Help fund and curate a start-up/ build application.
5. Save money and open a brew house/brewery or event space/music hall.
6. Use coding knowledge to create interactive art installations for each event hosted.
